// Unlike lua, python, javascript, etc, all luna code must run in a function
//
// Luna is designed to be embedded into a another program, there is a cli 
// embedding which lets you run code from the command line for convience 
//
// the cli embedding will call the main function first.
func main() {
    // the cli embedding also implements "print" to output to stdout
    print("Hello, World!");
